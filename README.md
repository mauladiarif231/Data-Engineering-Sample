```

## 4. Submitting Your Solution

Below is the steps to submit your solution:

1. Remove unncessary directories such as `jupyter/.ipynb_checkpoints/`, `postgres/db`, and `minio/data`. Your solution should be able to run without the local data that you created in your local development environment.
2. Zip the project directory.
3. Submit the zip file to the https://www.sawitpro.com/kirim-tugas.
